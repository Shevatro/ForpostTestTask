<p>Android app for displaying a simulation of the battle. It consists of 2 parts: maps and chronology list.</p>
<p>The map displays the fighter or equipment of the corresponding color of the team, by clicking on which a window with additional information displays.</p>
<p>The history shows the number of connected fighters and changes in their health status.</p>
<p>Data comes from real time db (firebase).</p>

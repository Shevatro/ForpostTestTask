Android app for displaying a simulation of the battle. It consists of 2 parts: maps and chronology list.
The map displays the fighter or equipment of the corresponding color of the team, by clicking on which a window with additional information displays.
The history shows the number of connected fighters and changes in their health status.
Data comes from real time db (firebase).
